> Problem Statement (AGRI12)


AI-based voice-assisted Contact Center for assisting Farmers for their problems. Farmers can log their problems with the contact center thru phone calls / SMS / website and in return an automated voice response can be provided to the farmers with a most appropriate solution for their problems.

## DATA SOURCE ðŸ“Š
- [Crop recommendation dataset ](https://www.kaggle.com/atharvaingle/crop-recommendation-dataset) 
- [Fertilizer suggestion dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gdabhishek/fertilizer-prediction) 
- [Disease detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset)

## Notebooks ðŸ““
- [Crop Recommendation](https://www.kaggle.com/atharvaingle/what-crop-to-grow)
- [Fertilizer Prediction](https://github.com/rudrakshi99/Farmer-Call-Center/blob/ml/notebook/geeks-on-fire-fertiliser-prediction.ipynb)
- [Disease Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/atharvaingle/plant-disease-classification-resnet-99-2)


## How to use ðŸ’»
- Crop Recommendation system ==> enter the corresponding nutrient values of your soil, state and city. Note that, the N-P-K (Nitrogen-Phosphorous-Pottasium) values to be entered should be the ratio between them. Refer [this website](https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/garden-how-to/soil-fertilizers/fertilizer-numbers-npk.htm) for more information.
Note: When you enter the city name, make sure to enter mostly common city names. Remote cities/towns may not be available in the [Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/) from where humidity, temperature data is fetched.

- Fertilizer suggestion system ==> Enter the nutrient contents of your soil and the crop you want to grow. The algorithm will tell which nutrient the soil has excess of or lacks. Accordingly, it will give suggestions for buying fertilizers.

- Disease Detection System ==> Upload an image of leaf of your plant. The algorithm will tell the crop type and whether it is diseased or healthy. If it is diseased, it will tell you the cause of the disease and suggest you how to prevent/cure the disease accordingly.
Note that, for now it only supports following crops
